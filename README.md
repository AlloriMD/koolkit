# KOOLKIT

> *Because sometimes, you really need that kool whatchamacallit...*

`Koolkit` is my personal Swiss Army Knife of handy utility functions. There are several libraries that are (*vastly*) more feature-complete than `koolkit`. To name two:

- [`boltons`](https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons) ([docs](https://boltons.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
- [`toolz`](https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz/) ([docs](https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

`Koolkit` is a personal project and will change continuously. Feel free to borrow what you find useful (MIT + CC-BY).
